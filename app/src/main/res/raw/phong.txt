Xuan Kong Flying Star feng shui or Xuan Kong Fei Xing is one of disciplines in Feng Shui, and is an integration of the principles of Yin Yang, the interactions between the five elements, the eight trigrams, the Lo Shu numbers, and the 24 Mountains, by using time, space and objects to create an astrological chart to analyze positive auras and negative auras of a building. 
These include analyzing wealth, mental and physiological states, success, relationships with external parties, and health of the inhabitant. 
During the Qing Dynasty, it was popularized by a grandmaster Shen Zhu Ren, with the book that he wrote called Mr. Shen's Study of Xuan Kong, or Shen Shi Xuan Kong Xue. 
Flying Star Feng Shui does not limit itself to buildings for the living or Yang Zhai, where rules pertaining to directions equally apply to all built structures; it also applies to grave sites and buildings for spirits or Yin Zhai. 
Timely and Untimely Flying Stars
A timely star is positive for a building whereas untimely star is negative. For the current period, Period 8 (Year 2004–2023), stars Eight, Nine and One are timely (For a building, they are timely if and only if the object placed in that palace is timely). Star Eight is most timely which is often treated as Prosperous and Noble Star. Star Nine and Star One belong to Sheng Qi, a growing energy. The other six stars are regarded as having retreating, killing or dead qi.
Taking Directions
Using the principles of Yin and Yang, the facing of a building is determined by the side of the built structure that receives most Yang Qi. 
A house is constructed with an architectural frontage with its side that faces whatever landscape feature. The facing of that house is considered by the direction of its frontage which is most Yang in nature. 
In apartments, or condominiums, the facing of a unit is determined by the facing of the entire building. If the structure is not an obvious facade, the facing of the unit is determined by the side of the building having the most Yang energy (faces the busiest crowd flow).
Taking locations
Energy in a building can be tapped into by locating a person within a sector that houses the energy. Ideally, living objects should be located in a sector with positive Qi as determined by Flying Star Chart. 
The layout of a building is demarcated with a Nine Palace grid, which looks like a tic-tac-toe grid. A door, room or other object's location refers to the square within this grid where the object is found. This may or may not correspond to the direction that the object faces. A door could be located in the southwest sector, but face south. Its location could be also southwest, and its direction to be facing to the south.
Mountain
Mountain generates Qi. A lush and green mountain or hill generates auspicious Qi, while a barren, rocky rising area will, in general, generate inauspicious energy. 
In urban areas, skyscrapers, apartments or any structure that rises from the ground have a similar role to a mountain: generating energy outside. From inside, cupboards, wardrobes, or any furniture that is taller or larger than any others nearby are also considered mountains. 
Water
Water conducts Qi. It is essential to identify the cleanliness of the water, the location and the flow of the water formation. These include ponds, lakes, rivers, drains and fountains. 
In urban areas, highways and lowland play a similar role to waterways, conducting Qi. Inside a building or a room, spinning fan or anything lower than ground level is considered water. 
Flying Star Chart
A Flying Star chart consists of three numbers in each Palace of the Luo Shu. These numbers are called the Base Star, the Facing Star and the Sitting Star.
Constructing a Flying Star Chart requires - The dates that the building was occupied by the owners - The facing of the building. 
For example, if a building is constructed in the year 2003, but the residents do not move in until February 4 of 2004, the Period of the building is 8, not 7.
Period does not change again unless there is major renovation undertaken to the structure.
